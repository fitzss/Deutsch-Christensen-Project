# Deutsch-Christensen-Project
Interweaving the ideas of David Deutsch and Clayton Christensen with respect to the fundamental connection between explanatory knowledge and technology.


"This increasingly intimate connection between explaining the world
and controlling it is no accident, but is part of the deep structure of the
world. Consider the set of all conceivable transformations of physical
objects. Some of those (like faster-than-light communication) never
happen because they are forbidden by laws of nature; some (like the
formation of stars out of primordial hydrogen) happen spontaneously;
and some (such as converting air and water into trees, or converting
raw materials into a radio telescope) are possible, but happen only
when the requisite knowledge is present – for instance, embodied in
genes or brains. But those are the only possibilities. That is to say,
every putative physical transformation, to be performed in a given time
with given resources or under any other conditions, is either
– impossible because it is forbidden by the laws of nature; or
– achievable, given the right knowledge.
That momentous dichotomy exists because if there were
transformations that technology could never achieve regardless of
what knowledge was brought to bear, then this fact would itself be a
testable regularity in nature. But all regularities in nature have
explanations, so the explanation of that regularity would itself be a law
of nature, or a consequence of one. And so, again, everything that is
not forbidden by laws of nature is achievable, given the right
knowledge." - Deutsch

**Where Capabilities Reside**
Our research suggests that three factors affect what an
organization **can and cannot do**: its resources, its processes, and its values. 
When thinking about what sorts of innovations their
organization will be able to embrace, managers need to assess
how each of these factors might affect their organization’s
capacity to change.

**Resources**
When they ask the question,
“What can this company do?” the
place most managers look for the answer is in its resources—
both the tangible ones like people, equipment, technologies,
and cash, and the less tangible ones like product designs,
information, brands, and relationships with suppliers,
distributors, and customers. Without doubt, access to abundant,
high-quality resources increases an organization’s chances of
coping with change. But resource analysis doesn’t come close to
telling the whole story.

**Processes**
The second factor that affects what a company can and cannot
do is its processes. By processes, we mean the patterns of
interaction, coordination, communication, and decision making
employees use to transform resources into products and
services of greater worth. Such examples as the processes that
govern product development, manufacturing, and budgeting
come immediately to mind. Some processes are formal, in the
sense that they are explicitly defined and documented. Others
are informal: they are routines or ways of working that evolve
over time. The former tend to be more visible, the latter less
visible.
One of the dilemmas of management is that processes, by
their very nature, are set up so that employees perform tasks in
a consistent way, time after time. They are meant not to change
or, if they must change, to change through tightly controlled
procedures. When people use a process to do the task it was
designed for, it is likely to perform efficiently. But when the
same process is used to tackle a very different task, it is likely to
perform sluggishly.  Companies focused on developing and
winning FDA approval for new drug compounds, for example,
often prove inept at developing and winning approval for
medical devices because the second task entails very different
ways of working. In fact, a process that creates the capability to
execute one task concurrently defines disabilities in executing
other tasks.

The most important capabilities and concurrent disabilities
aren’t necessarily embodied in the most visible processes, like
logistics, development, manufacturing, or customer service. In
fact, they are more likely to be in the less visible, background
processes that support decisions about where to invest
resources—those that define how market research is habitually
done, how such analysis is translated into financial projections,
how plans and budgets are negotiated internally, and so on. It is
in those processes that many organizations’ most serious
disabilities in coping with change reside.

**Values**
The third factor that affects what an organization can and
cannot do is its values
A company’s values reflect its cost
structure or its business model because those define the rules its
employees must follow for the company to prosper.
the first value dictates the way
the company judges acceptable gross margins.
The second value relates to how big a business opportunity
has to be before it can be interesting. Because a company’s stock
price represents the discounted present value of its projected
earnings stream, most managers feel compelled not just to
maintain growth but to maintain a constant rate of growth.
