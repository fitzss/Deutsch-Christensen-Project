# Deutsch-Christensen-Project
Interweaving the ideas of David Deutsch and Clayton Christensen with respect to the fundamental connection between explanatory knowledge and technology.


"This increasingly intimate connection between explaining the world
and controlling it is no accident, but is part of the deep structure of the
world. Consider the set of all conceivable transformations of physical
objects. Some of those (like faster-than-light communication) never
happen because they are forbidden by laws of nature; some (like the
formation of stars out of primordial hydrogen) happen spontaneously;
and some (such as converting air and water into trees, or converting
raw materials into a radio telescope) are possible, but happen only
when the requisite knowledge is present – for instance, embodied in
genes or brains. But those are the only possibilities. That is to say,
every putative physical transformation, to be performed in a given time
with given resources or under any other conditions, is either
– impossible because it is forbidden by the laws of nature; or
– achievable, given the right knowledge.
That momentous dichotomy exists because if there were
transformations that technology could never achieve regardless of
what knowledge was brought to bear, then this fact would itself be a
testable regularity in nature. But all regularities in nature have
explanations, so the explanation of that regularity would itself be a law
of nature, or a consequence of one. And so, again, everything that is
not forbidden by laws of nature is achievable, given the right
knowledge." - Deutsch
